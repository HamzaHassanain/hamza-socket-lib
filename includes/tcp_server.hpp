/**
 * @file tcp_server.hpp
 * @brief Abstract TCP server interface with comprehensive documentation.
 *
 * This header defines the abstract base class `tcp_server` which provides a
 * simple, documented interface that concrete server implementations must
 * implement. The class describes lifecycle hooks, I/O callbacks and control
 * methods used by implementations such as epoll-based or select-based servers.
 *
 * Design goals:
 * - Provide a minimal, clear interface for TCP server implementations.
 * - Separate transport-specific details (epoll, select, wepoll) from
 *   application-level callbacks (connections, messages, errors).
 * - Document expected behavior for each callback to make implementations
 *   and derived classes consistent and easy to use.
 *
 * @note This file only describes the interface. Concrete implementations
 *       must implement the pure virtual members defined below.

    /**
     * @brief Abstract interface for a TCP server implementation.
     *
     * The `tcp_server` class defines the callbacks and control operations a
     * concrete TCP server must provide. It is intentionally minimal so that
     * different I/O mechanisms (epoll, select, Windows IOCP, libuv, etc.) can
     * implement the interface while reusing common application logic.
     *
     * Responsibilities of a derived class:
     * - Manage the listening socket and accept incoming connections.
     * - Drive the I/O loop (platform-specific) and invoke the callbacks below
     *   when events occur.
     * - Ensure thread-safety where appropriate for the chosen design.
     *
     * Lifecycle and threading notes:
     * - listen() is expected to block and run the server loop until
     *   stop_server() is called or the server otherwise exits.
     * - Callbacks such as on_message_received may be called from the I/O
     *   thread; derived classes or users should document their threading
     *   guarantees if they change this behavior.
