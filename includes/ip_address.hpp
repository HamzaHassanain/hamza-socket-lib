     * @brief Represents an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) for network operations.
     *
     * This class provides a type-safe wrapper around IP address strings, offering
     * validation and convenient comparison operations. It can handle both IPv4
     * addresses (e.g., "192.168.1.1") and IPv6 addresses (e.g., "::1", "2001:db8::1").
     *
     * The class stores the IP address as a string representation, which is
     * platform-independent and suitable for both display and network operations.
     * It provides standard comparison operators for use in containers and sorting.
     *
     * @note Uses explicit constructors to prevent implicit conversions for type safety.
     * @note The class does not perform validation of IP address format - it stores
     *       whatever string is provided. Validation should be performed by the caller
     *       or higher-level network classes.
