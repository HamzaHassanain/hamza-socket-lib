     * @brief  Linux epoll-based TCP server
     *
     * This class implements a scalable TCP server using Linux's epoll mechanism
     * for efficient event-driven I/O. It can handle thousands of concurrent
     * connections with minimal system resources by using edge-triggered epoll
     * and non-blocking sockets.
     *
     * Key Features:
     * - Edge-triggered epoll for maximum performance
     * - Non-blocking accept loop for handling connection bursts
     * - Automatic write buffering and flow control
     * - Configurable file descriptor limits via setrlimit
     * - Thread-safe connection management
     *
     * Architecture:
     * - Single-threaded event loop (epoll_wait)
     * - Non-blocking I/O operations throughout
     * - Connection state tracking via epoll_connection struct
     * - Automatic cleanup of closed connections
     *
     * Performance Characteristics:
     * - O(1) event notification via epoll
     * - Scales to thousands of concurrent connections
     * - Minimal memory overhead per connection
     * - Efficient handling of partial reads/writes

     * @note This class is Linux-specific and requires kernel epoll support
     * @note Implements tcp_server interface
